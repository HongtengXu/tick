:mod:`mlpp.inference`: user-friendly inference tools
====================================================

These classes are called learners. They are meant to be very user friendly
and are most of the time good enough to infer many models.

These classes are scikit-learn compatible and, when it makes sense,
implement the following methods:

* `fit`
* `score`
* `predict`
